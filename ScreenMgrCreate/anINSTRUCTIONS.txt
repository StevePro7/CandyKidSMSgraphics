Update levels.txt
i.e. update all the screens required in the order that you need

Back up the previous work folders files etc.

Run the code and produce the latest artifacts

Copy n' paste the new screens across and skip the existing files

Manually update enum mgr and global mgr
Copy screen mgr across verbatim

Open DEV program
Include all the new screens into the project
Build to ensure all compiles + links OK

Update the build.bat
F1
but will most probably be "glitchy"

Therefore, manually build entire project and try again
