don't forget to make the font_manager data and dataZERO 6x placeholders

that way can score more than 65535 pts => 655350 pts

11_level02
inject the tree type
inject the bonus multiplier
swap candy=1 and trees=2 in all levels
I can't remember why I wanted to do this but I think it was something to do with collision
I must redo the game tiles to get a bit more color in the candy plus the all white free man candy + large death candy
Do I want to make the bonus and candy smaller compared to the trees

tidy up SRAM like my objects
add the array properties to stored collections of commands


inject all the properties for all the entities

refactor level load so do not include border
put the border tree logic into the board mgr

draw exits public vs. closed in board mgr
have array[2] for tree avoid vs. death
