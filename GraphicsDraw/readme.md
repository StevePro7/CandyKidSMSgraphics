32x32
16x tiles
4   wide
4   high

48x48
36x tiles
6x  high
6x  wide

64x64
64x tiles
8x  wide
8x  high

But don't think will bother with 64x64 boss
as could not render 64x64 boss AND CK on same plane


Finally, if wanted to have 2x 48x48 bosses then budget is:
36x tiles per boss * 2 animations =  72x tiles
double this for 2x bosses         = 144x tiles
Need CK = 8 + 4 for death
