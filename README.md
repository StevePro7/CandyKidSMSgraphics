Delete remote branch
https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-delete-remote-branches-in-git

After completing pull request for the BankFrames branch I want to delete the remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/BankFrames

NB: I had to update the .git config file to store the credentials in the URL
as I was not able to authenticate via the Github popup for some reason
