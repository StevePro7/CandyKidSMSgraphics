02.
Tiles
example

C:\GitHub\StevePro7\CandyKidSMSgraphics\GraphicsDraw\11_level02\gfx\raw

source
C:\GitHub\StevePro7\CandyKidSMSgraphics\Images2\_tiles

as there are currently not finished there are 4x variations:
AllTilesB12_C06
AllTilesB12_C08
AllTilesB14_C06
AllTilesB14_C08

These are built using the utility program
C:\GitHub\StevePro7\CandyKidSMSgraphics\GraphicsLoad_tiles_02

However, the death candy and oneup candy are not finished
neither are all the colors confirmed

Plus did I want to have arrows tiles??
